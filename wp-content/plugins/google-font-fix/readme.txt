Fix Google (//*.googleapis.com/*) and Gravatar service(//gravatar.com) for users in China.

== Description ==

**NOTE:** For non-Chinese vistors, they will still use the original links instead of mirror sites.

As we all know, the loading time become longer and longer for Chinese vistors because of the GFW in China.

The vistors are always waiting for loading fonts from [fonts.googleapis.com](http://fonts.googleapis.com) and avatars from [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com), until timeout.

To resolve this problem, we developed this plugin and replaced google libraries (`//*.googleapis.com`) with the service provided by QiHoo, USTC, and CSS.NET for Chinese users. For gravatar service, we replaced the links with `//cn.gravatar.com/avatar` or other alternative mirrors. You can change this in settings page.

After enabling this plugin, the user experience become much better for WordPress vistors in China.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `google-font-fix` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who need this plugin? =
  
It is mainly designed for Chinese WordPress sites. Because these people cannot access the API proviced by Google.
But I think every WordPress site can use this plugin if there are visitors from China.
